# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive course on **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**. This course bridges the gap between digital AI systems and physical robot bodies, focusing on embodied intelligence and real-world interaction.

## Course Overview

This course is structured into four core modules, each building upon the previous to provide a comprehensive understanding of humanoid robotics:

1. **ROS 2 – The Robotic Nervous System**: Learn the Robot Operating System 2, the middleware that connects all components of a robot.
2. **Gazebo & Unity – The Digital Twin**: Explore physics simulation and visualization tools for robot development and testing.
3. **NVIDIA Isaac – The AI-Robot Brain**: Understand AI frameworks that power autonomous robot behavior.
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) – The Complete System**: Integrate perception, cognition, and action for complete robot autonomy.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Design and implement humanoid robot control systems using ROS 2
- Create realistic simulations using Gazebo and Unity
- Deploy AI systems for perception and navigation using NVIDIA Isaac
- Integrate vision, language, and action systems for complete autonomy
- Implement an end-to-end autonomous humanoid system

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of programming concepts (Python preferred)
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Understanding of fundamental mathematics (linear algebra, calculus)
- Interest in robotics and AI systems

## Getting Help

If you encounter any issues or have questions while going through the course material, you can:

1. Use the embedded RAG chatbot that can answer questions based on this course content
2. Refer to the official ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, and Isaac documentation
