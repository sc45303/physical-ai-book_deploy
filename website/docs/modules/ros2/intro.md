# Module 1: ROS 2 - The Robotic Nervous System

This module introduces you to the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), the middleware that connects all components of a robot. ROS 2 provides the infrastructure for communication between different parts of a robotic system, enabling complex robot behaviors through the coordinated operation of many different components.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the core concepts of ROS 2, including nodes, topics, and services
- Create ROS 2 nodes that can communicate with each other
- Use ROS 2 tools for debugging and visualizing robot systems
- Implement basic robot control using ROS 2
- Bridge Python AI agents to ROS controllers using rclpy
- Create and use URDF models for humanoid robots

## Module Structure

This module contains 4 chapters that will progressively build your understanding of ROS 2:

1. [Chapter 1: Introduction to ROS 2 and Middleware Concepts](./chapter1.md) - Core concepts and architecture
2. [Chapter 2: ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services](./chapter2.md) - Communication patterns
3. [Chapter 3: Bridging Python Agents to ROS Controllers (rclpy)](./chapter3.md) - Connecting AI agents to ROS
4. [Chapter 4: URDF and Humanoid Robot Models](./chapter4.md) - Robot modeling

## What Makes ROS 2 Special for Humanoid Robots

ROS 2 provides several key advantages for humanoid robot development:

- **Modularity**: Different subsystems (perception, planning, control) can be developed independently and connected via ROS 2
- **Tool Ecosystem**: Extensive tools for visualization, debugging, and simulation
- **Hardware Abstraction**: Same high-level code can run on simulation or real hardware
- **Community**: Large community and extensive pre-built packages

## Prerequisites for This Module

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of Linux command line
- Familiarity with fundamental programming concepts (functions, classes, etc.)

## Getting Started

Begin with [Chapter 1: Introduction to ROS 2 and Middleware Concepts](./chapter1.md) to explore the core concepts and architecture of ROS 2.
