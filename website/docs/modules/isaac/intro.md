# Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac - The AI-Robot Brain

This module covers the NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem, which provides the AI "brain" for robotic systems. Isaac combines simulation capabilities with AI frameworks to enable the development of intelligent, autonomous robots that can perceive, reason, and act in complex environments.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem and its components
- Generate synthetic data for AI training using Isaac Sim
- Implement VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for robot navigation
- Use the Nav2 stack for path planning, specifically adapted for bipedal robots
- Apply advanced AI techniques for robot perception and control
- Optimize AI models for robotics applications

## Module Structure

This module contains 4 chapters that will progressively build your understanding of AI robotics:

1. [Chapter 1: Isaac Sim & Synthetic Data Generation](./chapter1.md) - AI simulation and data generation
2. [Chapter 2: Isaac ROS and VSLAM Navigation](./chapter2.md) - Visual navigation systems
3. [Chapter 3: Nav2 Path Planning for Bipedal Robots](./chapter3.md) - Specialized path planning
4. [Chapter 4: Advanced AI-Robot Brain Techniques](./chapter4.md) - Advanced AI applications
